# Sales Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict sales outcomes based on customer data. It's designed to assist sales teams in making informed decisions and improving conversion rates.

## Data

This project utilizes a custom sales dataset (replace `Book2.csv` with the path to your data). The data underwent pre-processing steps to handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and potential outliers.

## Model

The project employs an XGBoost classifier. XGBoost is known for its efficiency and accuracy in handling various data types, making it a suitable choice for sales prediction tasks. Additionally, it achieved the highest accuracy compared to other models tested (mention the models if applicable).

## Training

The model was trained on an 80/20 random train-test split. No feature selection method was used in this iteration, but this can be explored if your data has a large number of features. The final model achieved an accuracy score of 82.2%.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated on the hold-out test set. It achieved an accuracy of 82.2%, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data. However, it's important to acknowledge that real-world sales prediction can involve complex relationships. Further refinement through feature engineering and other techniques might be necessary.

## Limitations

* The model's accuracy is dependent on the quality and representativeness of the data used.
* Potential biases in the data could influence the model's predictions.
* Further data collection and experimentation could enhance the model's generalizability.

## Future Work

* Exploring feature engineering techniques to extract more informative features from the data.
* Incorporating additional data sources (e.g., market trends, customer demographics) for a more holistic view.
* Investigating alternative machine learning models, such as deep learning architectures or ensemble methods.

## Note

This code is a starting point for a sales prediction model. Further development and experimentation are recommended to improve its accuracy and generalizability.

## Running the Model

Paste the following code directly into your Jupyter Notebook (or Python script) to run the model:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Replace 'Book2.csv' with the actual path to your CSV file
master_data = pd.read_csv('Book2.csv', sep=',', encoding='latin-1')
print('data shape: ', master_data.shape)

# ... (rest of your code)
